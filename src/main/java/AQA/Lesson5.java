public class Lesson5 {

// 1. **Basic Interface**:
//   Create an interface named `Animal` with a method `makeSound()`. Then create several classes such as `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Cow` that implement this interface and provide a specific implementation for the `makeSound()` method.

    // Please see Animal Interface and class Cat, Cow, Dog.


// 2. **Interface with Default Methods**:
//   Extend the previous `Animal` interface by adding a default method `isPet()` that returns a boolean value. Implement this in some of your classes.


// 3. **Multiple Implementations**:
//   Create two interfaces, `LandVehicle` and `WaterVehicle`, each with unique methods. Then create a class `AmphibiousVehicle` that implements both interfaces.


// 4. **Functional Interface and Lambda Expressions**:
//   Create a functional interface `Calculator` with a method `calculate` that takes two integers and returns an integer. Use this interface with a lambda expression to perform basic arithmetic operations.
