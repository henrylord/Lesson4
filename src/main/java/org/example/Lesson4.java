//## 1. Overloading Methods
//Create a Class with Overloaded Methods:** Design a class `Calculator` that has overloaded methods for `add`, capable of adding two or three integers.
//Please see class `Calculator`
//In java, we do method overloading in two ways:
//By changing the number of parameters.
//By changing data types.



//### 2. Overloading Constructors
//1. **Create a Class with Overloaded Constructors:** Design a class `Box` with overloaded constructors to initialize a boxâ€™s dimensions in different ways.
//Please see class  `Box`
//Constructor Overloading allows for object initialization with different initial states.
//Reduces code duplication
//Increases code readability


// ### 3. Using Objects as Parameters

//1. **Modify an Object in a Method:** Create a method that modifies the properties of an object passed as a parameter.

    // PLease see Box class method "shrinkBoxByFactor(Box obj, int factor)".


//2. **Object Passing Test:** Write a class with a method that takes an object of another class as a parameter and modifies one of its fields.

    // PLease see Box class and BoxModifier class


//3. **Comparison Method:** Write a method that compares two objects passed as parameters and returns the object with the higher value in a specific field.

    //PLease see Box class method compareBox(Box obj1, Box obj2)


// 4. **Array of Objects as Parameter:** Create a method that takes an array of objects as a parameter and performs a specific operation on each object.

    // Please see Car class method mostExpensiveCar(Car[] c) and main method


// 5. **Understanding Object References:** Demonstrate with code how Java passes objects to methods by reference, not by value.
