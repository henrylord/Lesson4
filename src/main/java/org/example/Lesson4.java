//## 1. Overloading Methods
//Create a Class with Overloaded Methods:** Design a class `Calculator` that has overloaded methods for `add`, capable of adding two or three integers.
//Please see class `Calculator`
//In java, we do method overloading in two ways:
//By changing the number of parameters.
//By changing data types.



//### 2. Overloading Constructors
//1. **Create a Class with Overloaded Constructors:** Design a class `Box` with overloaded constructors to initialize a boxâ€™s dimensions in different ways.
//Please see class  `Box`
//Constructor Overloading allows for object initialization with different initial states.
//Reduces code duplication
//Increases code readability


// ### 3. Using Objects as Parameters
